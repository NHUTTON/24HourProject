# 24HourProject


This project was extremely frustrating. Most of our issues stemmed from not knowing how to operate through branches in the best way possible, how to delegate tasks, 
and how to make sure that our individual components worked in tandem. I think for future 24 hour projects, it would be a great idea to model the teams after a 
specific company's structure. Asking a company how their teams work and how they divy up tasks, and then reflecting that model with the project. Also, I think
it would've been WAY less of a headache if EFA created a server/API for us to build a 24 hour project from. This way we can ask LAs questions that they can
actually answer. A lot of the documentation was vague, so this would solve for that (especially because we have a time crunch). I had a lot of things going on 
last night that I could not miss, so working through this code was especially stressful (which is to be expected but not entirely conducive of the best 
learner outcomes for my own learning style). I do have to say though, I really enjoyed working with Nick. Talking through code helped me to solidify how I conceptualize
useState, useEffect, and react/reactstrap generally. While our app is not the prettiest, it is functional after hours of testing. I am rather proud of our work :)
