# 24HourProject

This was a fun challenging way to implement group work. Both myself and Connor faced seperate challenges but were able to come together 
and create a viable woring application.

React makes it very simple to add different stylings as well as pull information in a more streamlines way. 

I like using react but definitely need more time to study up on the docs.

All in all i was pretty happy we were able to get a wokring product and look forward to more group work. 

This helped clarify how two people can pull their knowledge into an application and use different skill sets to achieve one goal.
